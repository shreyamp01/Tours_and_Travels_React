Tours and Travel Booking Site - MERN Stack Project
üåç Project Overview
Welcome to the repository of my Travel Booking Site, a web application developed using React.  This project is designed to offer users a seamless experience in browsing and booking travel tours. With features allowing users to search for trips by location, distance, and number of travelers, our platform aims to personalize the travel planning experience. Users can log in to their profiles, book tours, and leave reviews (stars and written feedback) for each trip.

Node.js & Express.js: For server-side logic and RESTful API development.
